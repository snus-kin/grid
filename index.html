                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>This piece is the product of my final year project, <i>"Using
                Generative Art Technique to Explore the Work of Darrell
                Viner"</i></p>

                <p>Darrell Viner (1946-2001) was an early computer artist,
                though his work was primarily sculpture, he produced many pen
                plotter works <a href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?images_exist=true&page=1&id_person=A40101&id_technique=x43893">available
                    to view at the V&A</a>.</p>

                <p>This project seeks to allow you to explore some 'world'
                which these images lived in, allowing you to modify parameters
                to explore this landscape. There is also audio which is
                generated based on these parameters.</p>

                <p>All of this occurs in your browser, and is powered using <a
                href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a
            href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a>.
